# RCDroid

RCDroid is an android app, allowing the phone to be used as the brains of a remote control car. It generates a web interface for user interaction, providing data from the onboard sensors. Control of the car is handled through a USB servo controller, namely a [Pololu Micro Maestro 6](http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1350/).
